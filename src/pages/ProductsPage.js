      description: `
      <p>Semi husked coconuts are mature coconuts with the outer green husk partially removed, leaving the hard shell intact while retaining some of the fibrous coir. 
      This makes them ideal for export as they are more compact than fully husked coconuts, while still offering protection to the inner shell and water content.
      These coconuts are naturally rich in coconut water and have thick, firm white meat, making them ideal for various culinary and industrial purposes. 
      They are harvested in a matured state and selected carefully for quality, weight, and shelf life.</p>
